Credit-card-fraud-detection:
	This project implements a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. Leveraging techniques to handle highly imbalanced datasets, the system 		aims to accurately identify fraudulent activities while minimizing false alarms.

Key Features:

	Data Preprocessing: Handles raw transaction data, including feature scaling for optimal model performance.
 
	Imbalanced Data Handling: Employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset, ensuring the model effectively learns patterns of rare fraudulent 		 		transactions.
 
	Random Forest Classifier: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier as the primary supervised learning model for its robust performance, ability to capture complex non-linear relationships, 	and effective handling of diverse features.
 
	Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest): Includes an Isolation Forest model as a complementary unsupervised approach to identify outliers and novel fraud patterns not explicitly seen in 		the training data.
 
	Comprehensive Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets, focusing on Precision, Recall, F1-score for the fraud class, and Average P			ecision Score (AUPRC). This provides a clear picture of the system's ability to catch fraud while managing false positives.
 
	Real-time Ready: Designed with considerations for integration into real-time transaction monitoring systems.
	 

How it Works:
	The system processes transaction data, transforming raw features into a suitable format. To overcome the challenge of very few fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones, 		SMOTE is applied to the training data. The core of the system is a powerful Random Forest Classifier trained on this balanced data, learning to distinguish between fraudulent and 			legitimate transactions. Additionally, an Isolation Forest provides an alternative layer of detection, identifying suspicious anomalies. Model performance is rigorously assessed to 		ensure high accuracy in identifying fraud and minimizing customer inconvenience.
